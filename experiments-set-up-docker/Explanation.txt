Set up the different situations (docker environment) of the experiments.

1. Following the README, choose a scalability, i.e., 2K, 20K, and 2M, to generate the data;

2. Following the README, make a copy of the '.env.example' file, and set the SCALE (could be 20000, 200000, and 2000000) and COMPOSE_PROFILES (could be hom, het, sc1 and sc2) argument and then run the command 'docker-compose up' to set up the OBDF and OBDA instances for query answering testing.
   Here, for simplification, the set up of hom and het also contains the source for materialized views. This means that hom and het are the federation instances with materialization;


NOTE THAT: here source s5 (s5p) denotes s2 (s2p) in the paper, and source s2 (s2p) denotes s5 (s5p).
